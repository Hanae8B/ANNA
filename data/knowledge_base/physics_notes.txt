# Physics Research Knowledge Base

Quantum Gravity:
- Approaches: Loop Quantum Gravity, String Theory, Emergent Spacetime
- Open questions: singularities, Planck-scale phenomena, holography
- Key references: Rovelli (Loop Quantum Gravity), Polchinski (String Theory)

EPR Paradox:
- Challenges completeness of quantum mechanics
- Involves entangled particle correlations, Bell inequalities

Uncertainty Principle:
- Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2
- Limits simultaneous measurement precision for conjugate variables

Electron Stability:
- Electron is stable under Standard Model
- BSM physics may hypothetically allow decay; experimental limits from Super-Kamiokande

Fundamental Nature of Matter:
- Constituents: quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, Higgs
- Open questions: dark matter, neutrino hierarchy, matter-antimatter asymmetry
