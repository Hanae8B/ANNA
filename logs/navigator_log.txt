2025-09-12T22:52:34.128063 | ACTION: Analyze scientific query: 'double split experiment' | CONFIRMED: True | RESPONSE: Alternating Stationary Iterative Methods Based on Double Splittings
Matrix double splitting iterations are simple in implementation while solving
real non-singular (rectangular) linear systems. In this paper, we present two
Alternating Double Splitting (ADS) schemes formulated by two double splittings
and then alternating the respective iterations. The convergence conditions are
then discussed along with comparative analysis. The set of double splittings
used in each ADS schemes induce a preconditioned system which helps in showing
the convergence of the ADS schemes. We also show that the classes of matrices
for which one ADS scheme is better than the other are mutually exclusive.
Numerical experiments confirm the proposed ADS schemes are superior to the
existing methods in actual implementation. Though the problems are considered
in the rectangular matrix settings, the same problems are even new in
non-singular matrix settings.

Splitting of the Raman $2D$ band of graphene subjected to strain
The Raman $2D$-band -important for the analysis of graphene- shows a
splitting for uniaxial strain. The splitting depends on the strength and
direction of the applied strain and on the polarization of the incident and
outgoing light. We expand the double-resonance Raman model in order to explain
the strain direction dependence and the polarization dependence of the
splitting. The analysis of this splitting gives new insight into the origin of
the $2D$-band. Our prediction of the strain direction and polarization
dependence agrees well with recent experiments.

Tseng Splitting Method with Double Inertial Steps for Solving Monotone
  Inclusion Problems
In this paper, based on a double inertial extrapolation steps strategy and
relaxation techniques, we introduce a new Tseng splitting method with double
inertial extrapolation steps and self-adaptive step sizes for solving monotone
inclusion problems in real Hilbert spaces. Finally, several numerical
experiments are provided to illustrate the performance and theoretical outcomes
of our algorithm.

Conventional versus single-ladder-splitting contributions to double
  parton scattering production of two quarkonia, two Higgs bosons and $c \bar c
  c \bar c$
The double parton distributions (dPDF), both conventional and those
corresponding to parton splitting, are calculated and compared for different
two-parton combinations. The conventional and splitting dPDFs have very similar
shape in $x_1$ and $x_2$. We make a first quantitative evaluation of the
single-ladder-splitting contribution to double parton scattering (DPS)
production of two S- or P-wave quarkonia, two Higgs bosons and $c \bar c c \bar
c$. The ratio of the single-ladder-splitting to conventional contributions is
discussed as a function of centre-of-mass energy, mass of the produced system
and other kinematical variables. Using a simple model for the dependence of the
conventional two-parton distribution on transverse parton separation (Gaussian
and independent of $x_i$ and scales), we find that the 2v1 contribution is as
big as the 2v2 contribution discussed in recent years in the literature. This
means that the phenomenological analyses of $\sigma_{eff}$ including only the
conventional DPS mechanism have to be revised including explicitly the
single-ladder-splitting contributions discussed here. The differential
distributions in rapidity and transverse momenta calculated for conventional
and single-ladder-splitting DPS processes are however very similar which causes
their experimental separation to be rather difficult, if not impossible. The
direct consequence of the existence of the two components (conventional and
splitting) is the energy and process dependence of the empirical parameter
$\sigma_{eff}$. This is illustrated in our paper for the considered processes.

Double parton scattering in double logarithm approximation of
  perturbative QCD
Using the explicit form of the known single distribution functions (the
Green's functions) in the double logarithm approximation of perturbative QCD,
we analyze the structure of splitting diagrams as a source of double parton
perturbative correlations in the proton. The related phenomenological effects
are discussed for the conditions of the LHC experiments.

A underlying dynamical structure for both relativity and quantum
theory-``superrelativity'' has been proposed in order to overcome the well
known incompatibility between these theories. The relationship between
curvature of spacetime (gravity) and curvature of the projective Hilbert space
of pure quantum states is established as well.

Factorization of alternating sums of Virasoro characters
G. Andrews proved that if $n$ is a prime number then the coefficients $a_k$
and $a_{k+n}$ of the product $(q,q)_\infty/(q^n,q^n)_\infty=\sum_k a_kq^k$ have
the same sign, see [A1]. We generalize this result in several directions. Our
results are based on the observation that many products can be written as
alternating sums of characters of Virasoro modules.

Algebraic Type Theory and Universe Hierarchies
It is commonly believed that algebraic notions of type theory support only
universes \`a la Tarski, and that universes \`a la Russell must be removed by
elaboration. We clarify the state of affairs, recalling the details of
Cartmell's discipline of _generalized algebraic theory_, showing how to
formulate an algebraic version of Coquand's cumulative cwfs with universes \`a
la Russell. To demonstrate the power of algebraic techniques, we sketch a
purely algebraic proof of canonicity for Martin-L\"of Type Theory with
universes, dependent function types, and a base type with two constants.

Black Hole Entropy and the Dimensional Continuation of the Gauss-Bonnet
  Theorem
The Euclidean black hole has topology $\Re^2 \times {\cal S}^{d-2}$. It is
shown that -in Einstein's theory- the deficit angle of a cusp at any point in
$\Re^2$ and the area of the ${\cal S}^{d-2}$ are canonical conjugates. The
black hole entropy emerges as the Euler class of a small disk centered at the
horizon multiplied by the area of the ${\cal S}^{d-2}$ there.These results are
obtained through dimensional continuation of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The
extension to the most general action yielding second order field equations for
the metric in any spacetime dimension is given.

Levy preservation and associated properties for $f$-divergence minimal
  equivalent martingale measures
We study such important properties of $f$-divergence minimal martingale
measure as Levy preservation property, scaling property, invariance in time
property for exponential Levy models. We give some useful decomposition for
$f$-divergence minimal martingale measures and we answer on the question which
form should have $f$ to ensure mentioned properties. We show that $f$ is not
necessarily common $f$-divergence. For common $f$-divergences, i.e. functions
verifying $f"(x) = ax^ {\gamma},\, a>0,\, \gamma \in \mathbb R$, we give
necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of $f$-minimal martingale
measure.

The New World Order (NWO) is a term often used in conspiracy theories which hypothesize a secretly emerging totalitarian world government. The common theme in conspiracy theories about a New World Order is that a secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian one-world government—which will replace sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails the establishment of the New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been alleged to be part of a cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.
Before the early 1990s, New World Order conspiracism was limited to two American countercultures, primarily the militantly anti-government right, and secondarily the part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the eschatological end-time emergence of the Antichrist. Academics who study conspiracy theories and religious extremism, such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet, observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order not only have been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but also have seeped into popular culture, thereby fueling a surge of interest and participation in survivalism and paramilitarism as many people actively prepare for apocalyptic and millenarian scenarios. These political scientists warn that mass hysteria over New World Order conspiracy theories could eventually have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues.
2025-09-12T22:58:43.755694 | ACTION: Analyze scientific query: 'is it possible to have a stroke and no side effects?' | CONFIRMED: True | RESPONSE: Ergotropic advantage in a measurement-fueled quantum heat engine
This paper investigates a coupled two-qubits heat engine fueled by
generalized measurements of the spin components and using a single heat
reservoir as sink. Our model extends the four-stroke engine proposed by Yi and
coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] by introducing an
ergotropy-extracting stroke, resulting in a five-stroke cycle. For measurements
along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield
an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the
engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine (without
the adiabatic strokes) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine.
For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the
total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work
outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For
measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of
the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we
illustrate for specific cases (x-x and x-z directions), a definite ordering is
obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke
engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as
three-stroke counterparts.

Polar Stroking: New Theory and Methods for Stroking Paths
Stroking and filling are the two basic rendering operations on paths in
vector graphics. The theory of filling a path is well-understood in terms of
contour integrals and winding numbers, but when path rendering standards
specify stroking, they resort to the analogy of painting pixels with a brush
that traces the outline of the path. This means important standards such as
PDF, SVG, and PostScript lack a rigorous way to say what samples are inside or
outside a stroked path. Our work fills this gap with a principled theory of
stroking.
  Guided by our theory, we develop a novel polar stroking method to render
stroked paths robustly with an intuitive way to bound the tessellation error
without needing recursion. Because polar stroking guarantees small uniform
steps in tangent angle, it provides an efficient way to accumulate arc length
along a path for texturing or dashing. While this paper focuses on developing
the theory of our polar stroking method, we have successfully implemented our
methods on modern programmable GPUs.

MIDAS: Multi-sensorial Immersive Dynamic Autonomous System Improves
  Motivation of Stroke Affected Patients for Hand Rehabilitation
Majority of stroke survivors are left with poorly functioning paretic hands.
Current rehabilitation devices have failed to motivate the patients enough to
continue rehabilitation exercises. The objective of this project, MIDAS
(Multi-sensorial Immersive Dynamic Autonomous System) is a proof of concept by
using an immersive system to improve motivation of stroke patients for hand
rehabilitation. MIDAS is intended for stroke patients who suffer from light to
mild stroke. MIDAS is lightweight and portable. It consists of a hand
exoskeleton subsystem, a Virtual Reality (VR) subsystem, and an olfactory
subsystem. Altogether, MIDAS engages four out of five senses during
rehabilitation. To evaluate the efficacy of MIDAS a pilot study consisting of
three sessions is carried out on five stroke affected patients. Subsystems of
MIDAS are added progressively in each session. The game environment, sonic
effects, and scent released is carefully chosen to enhance the immersive
experience. 60% of the scores of user experience are above 40 (out of 56). 96%
Self Rehabilitation Motivation Scale (SRMS) rating shows that the participants
are motivated to use MIDAS and 87% rating shows that MIDAS is exciting for
rehabilitation. Participants experienced elevated motivation to continue stroke
rehabilitation using MIDAS and no undesired side effects were reported.

From Conception to Deployment: Intelligent Stroke Prediction Framework
  using Machine Learning and Performance Evaluation
Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Machine learning
classification algorithms have been widely adopted for stroke prediction.
However, these algorithms were evaluated using different datasets and
evaluation metrics. Moreover, there is no comprehensive framework for stroke
data analytics. This paper proposes an intelligent stroke prediction framework
based on a critical examination of machine learning prediction algorithms in
the literature. The five most used machine learning algorithms for stroke
prediction are evaluated using a unified setup for objective comparison.
Comparative analysis and numerical results reveal that the Random Forest
algorithm is best suited for stroke prediction.

Stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to a part of the brain causes cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly.
Signs and symptoms of stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than 24 hours, the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. Hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control.
The most significant risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include high blood cholesterol, tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. Ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam and supported by medical imaging such as a CT scan or MRI scan. A CT scan can rule out bleeding, but may not necessarily rule out ischemia, which early on typically does not show up on a CT scan. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms.
Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic carotid narrowing, and anticoagulant medication in people with atrial fibrillation. Aspirin or statins may be recommended by physicians for prevention. Stroke is a medical emergency. Ischemic strokes, if detected within three to four-and-a-half hours, may be treatable with medication that can break down the clot, while hemorrhagic strokes sometimes benefit from surgery. Treatment to attempt recovery of lost function is called stroke rehabilitation, and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however, these are not available in much of the world.
In 2023, 15 million people worldwide had a stroke. In 2021, stroke was the third biggest cause of death, responsible for approximately 10% of total deaths. In 2015, there were about 42.4 million people who had previously had stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the annual incidence of stroke decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world, but increased by 10% in the developing world. In 2015, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease, accounting for 6.3 million deaths (11% of the total). About 3.0 million deaths resulted from ischemic stroke while 3.3 million deaths resulted from hemorrhagic stroke. About half of people who have had a stroke live less than one year. Overall, two thirds of cases of stroke occurred in those over 65 years old.
